/**
 * The ZC_SDWebImageManager is the class behind the UIImageView+ZCSD_WebCache category and likes.

 * a UIView.
 *
 * Here is a simple example of how to use ZC_SDWebImageManager:
 *
 * @code

ZC_SDWebImageManager *manager = [ZC_SDWebImageManager sharedManager];
[manager loadImageWithURL:imageURL
